# Reconfiguration Redistricting Graphs

## graves-original-altered.py

Code was originally by Christine Graves, a graduate student from Princeton. This code has been modified to produce histograms for the number of seats that the Yellow party would win given a random walk through the state space. 

## no_diagonals_redistricting_10_by_10_colums.py

This code was also heavily based on code from Christine Graves but has been modified so that districts connected by diagonal squares do not count.
